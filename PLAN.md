1. setup image as background on website.

2. design front end data, what it looks like

> {
>   id,
>   x,
>   y,
>   height,
>   width,
>   label,
>   type,
>   text/content,
>   isRequired,
>   time?,
>   touched?,
>   fontSize?,
> }

3. create 1 input field
  - using passedProps

4. create multiple input field

#####

5. look up redux store
  - how does redux data look like for 2 TextInputs?

6. connect third party form library

7. save user input

1. actually being able to choose which file.
